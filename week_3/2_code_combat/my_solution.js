// Reflection:
// Write your reflection here.
// First, the challenge-specific questions.
// 	* "this" is the js object that is your selected character. Not the wizard guy I made, but the sprites he's controlling.
// 	  All of the actions following "this." are methods of that object.
// 	* The () syntactically identifies functions/methods. It also holds any parameters of that function/method.
// 	* The semicolons explicitly end each discrete line of code. It's a clear signal to the computer to stop reading and execute
// 	  the current chunk of code. Without semicolons, the computer would have to divide up the code into discrete steps implicitly.
// 	  Ruby doesn't seem to mind that step, but divvying it up explicitly removes any guesswork. Also makes for a whole class of
// 	  annoying typo, but c'est la vie.

// I had already gone through the CodeAcademy JS course before doing this challenge, so the basic syntax of JS methods was familiar
// to me. Honestly, that was the only JS-specific task of the beginning missions, and fully half of the coding tasks (the other half
// was simply to explicitly write every step of a given process). With all that, the real issues were level-specific: understanding
// the scope of each level's task; getting a feel for the specific mechanics of each methodâ€”the distance each .moveDirection took the
// sprite, the range of various actions, etc; the timing and trajectory of an ogre's retaliatory charge. I'm actually curious, looking
// through the Learning Competencies, at the bit about syntax error messages. The syntax of Code Combat, at least to start, is really
// simple and I didn't make a simgle error.

// I thought I'd enjoy the artillery level more than the dungeon bit, but I didn't. The cartesian navigation was more interesting in
// theory, but just added a level of tedium in practice. Given a task that simple, the added complexity just meant I had to do one or
// two more tests to get the parameters just right.

// So, to wrap up, I feel totaly confident with this challenge. The syntax was familiar, the logical demands were fairly trivial, and
// each instance of troubleshooting followed the same mental narrative of "I'll try algorithm A because it takes less typing; if that
// doesn't work, I'll have to (add this fairly obvious other step || tweak this parameter a bit)".
