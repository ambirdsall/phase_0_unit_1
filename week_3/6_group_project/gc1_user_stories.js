// My role in the group is: Person 1

// Here is my part of the challenge:
// I want this program to be able to take a bunch of numbers and give me various answers about them: I want it to be able to add 
// up all the numbers and give me the sum; I want to be able to get the average of all the numbers; and I want to be able to get 
// the median of all the numbers. It needs to be able to do all that stuff for whatever set of numbers I throw at it.


// Reflection:
// I was super excited reading the premise of the group project, although I really wanted to be involved in the actual coding.
// Instead, I had the role of creating the user stories and evaluating the refactored code vis. the tests. It wasn't altogether
// boring: I really enjoy reading code directly, so figuring out the necessary tasks from the test code was fun. Nonetheless,
// I felt a bit left out. I sent out my user stories and, some days later, was given a set of tidy code that was most of the
// way to being what we needed. While I saw what my user stories got across and what they didn't, the feeling was less "aha" 
// than "oh, right".

// Our group wasn't successful in passing most of the tests. Tests number 1-6 foundered on the fact that our code for sum and 
// mean weren't functions. The logic of our operations was perfect, and the code was clean and legible: it would have been a 
// really nice solution had it been inside a function's code block. But if wishes were horses, we'd all be eating steak. Unlike
// the other two operations, median WAS a function. When tests 1-6 were commented out, we passed 7-9 with a clean slate.

// It was a pretty good object lesson for me about writing user stories: you can't be too specific. It was a little hard having
// to work around the technical language; in retrospect, it would have made life easier (or the tests more successful, in any
// case) had I put in something like "these actions should be modular, so that I can use the same product on any set of numbers
// I want". Even rephrasing it here, I found it hard not to use the word "functions" instead of "actions". Even though the word
// has a technical meaning, it also has a common language meaning that fits nicely in context. I definitely struggled with that
// ethically, and I'm not sure where precisely the line lies. Still, going more in-depth with my user stories would have let me
// paint a more vivid picture indicating implicitly some structural matters for the final code, as well as its arithmetical
// functionalities.




// - What was this experience like? 
// - Was your group successful in passing the tests? 
// - What did you learn about writing user stories, pseudocoding, writing code, refactoring, etc.?
