// This is a solo challenge

// Your mission description:
// CAT BURGLAR! Steal the jewels by night. That's why there's no graphics. Because it's dark.
// You drop through a window into a jewelry store. That's where the game opens. You know one safe path past the motion detectors.
// You have to sneak 10' forwards, turn left, sneak 10' forwards, turn right, sneak 5' forwards, snatch the jewels. Luckily, you've
// trained long and hard to sneak exactly 5' at a time. Then you retrace your steps (turn either direction x2 first, natch) and climb 
// back out the window.

// Pseudocode
// burglar object with location (x,y) and methods: sneak forwards in increments of 5', turn left, turn right, snatch jewels, climb out
