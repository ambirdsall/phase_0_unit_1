## 1. [Git and Github](1_get_started/readme.md) Reflection

* What struggles did you have setting up git and GitHub? What did you learn in the process?
* Write an explanation of and compare git and GitHub to a non-technical audience. 
* Describe what version control is and how GitHub helps with it.
* Why do developers use version control (git)? Does that make sense to you? Why or why not?
* What doesn't make sense? What does?

I didn't run into any real snags in the actual set up of git and GitHub; the closest I came to trouble was a 5-second setback when I couldn't remember whether the '$' was part of the terminal command I was copying. I'm nowhere near fluent in git commands yet, but that will come quickly as I delve into using it. 

By far the most significant thing I learned working through the git/GitHub introductory material was the mechanics of git's version control. I didn't know about git as separate from GitHub, which I had heard of as a nexus of code sharing. My mental picture of it, though, was "vague black box on the internet where all the code lives". Learning about git's processes of branching, forking, and logging all changes demystified GitHub, which now seems like an obvious and useful resource.

So. Git is software that lets you keep track of changes to a given project. The beauty of it is that, rather than having to save a new version of an entire file each time you make changes, it lets you take successive snapshots of specific changes, with a brief explanitory note. There's a lot of benefits to working like this: for one, if you mess up down the line, the pre-mistake version is right there in the log. It also makes it very easy to experiment: you can make several different copies of a file, track them through various approaches, and then keep the one you like best. Managing these different versions of the same project is, appropriately enough, known as "version control". GitHub is a service that hosts copies of those projects online, which makes it easy to share and collaborate. Since changes to git projects are logged individually, combining the efforts of different people working on different parts of a large project at the same time is simple and straightforward, and since all those changes are recorded to the same service, you don't have to keep in contact with each collaborator individually to keep track of their work. GitHub, essentially, removes a lot of hassle from version control of a collaboration.

Since coding projects can become beasts of enormous complexity, version control serves as a particularly useful sort of safety net. Comparing versions of a project after various changes can help isolate the source of a problem; maintaining records of earlier versions can save lots of time after unfortunate edits. Working with that safety net makes an experimental approach to coding a whole lot less fraught than it would otherwise be; that diversity of problem-solving leads to more efficient, creative work. Makes plenty of sense.

Really, the conceptual framework for both git and GitHub seems pretty straightforward to me. The details of and the commands for actually making commits and reviewing other people's work still remain to be mastered, but the big-picture seems clear enough.
