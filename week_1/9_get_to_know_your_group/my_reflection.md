	Hello folks!

	Sorry this is a few days late: I was traveling last week and had to finish the work over the last day or two. I'm from Vermont, but I'm living in Portland, OR at the moment teaching elementary school kids art. Looking forward to meeting you guys. I'm on the line between Abstract Random and Abstract Sequential; my learning style is multimodal. Or maybe I'm just indecisive. Antonio, are you a musician? I like to play and write notes, whether on a guitar or keys or viola or Reason 4.0.

	I hope you guys are rolling on the work. I just did my GPS 1.1 today and turns out I really enjoy peer pairing. We might want to start using this email thread to schedule them amongst ourselves—I need to figure out my schedule in a bit more detail, but weekends and late mornings Pacific time I'm free.

	Cheers,
	Alex

Take a moment to reflect on reading other people's responses regarding their fears about DBC. How did that make you feel? Did you feel better, worse, or something else all together? How has your experience this week influenced your feelings? All feelings are welcome and ok. Just take a moment to think about it and write it down. 

Man. MAN. I feel so much better and worse at once reading people's fears and worries about this. It's super freeing to see someone straight up admit that they're flawed and nervous, because I am too. I'm gaining confidence that I can learn the type of material we'll go over here; meanwhile, the scope of the effort ahead of me keeps looking bigger and bigger, like a super long zoom out in a film. AND IT'S STILL ZOOMING. I think it'll be good—the emotional structure of Dev Bootcamp is making it easy for me to feel and remain accountable to myself, which I'll need if I'm going to work as hard as I think I'll have to. It makes me nervous! I haven't needed to pull this deep into my self-discipline in a long, long time. I'm afraid of what that will feel like and even more afraid of what failing to do that would feel like. But as my understanding of DBC moves from impression and projection to observation and understanding, it's looking like my somewhat optimistic hopes were onto something. I thrive in environments where there's a bit of structure and a lot of earnestness, and I'm at a time in my life where I'm really seeking those things out. I also feel good about how the coupled intellectual and artistic engagement I'm enjoying most about this is exactly the thing that is emphasized as the thing that can carry me as a developer into the "real world". As an introverted English major in the late economy, I've been stressed about money for a while now, and this can be a way out if I work hard and seize it. Which is still scary.

I can run in circles with those feelings, and frequently do, so I'll end with this: so far, coding is still fun. May that continue.
