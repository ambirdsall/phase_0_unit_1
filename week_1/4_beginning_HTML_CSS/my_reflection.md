## 4.[Beginning HTML and CSS](4_beginning_HTML_CSS/readme.mc) Reflection

* What makes sense to your about HTML? What doesn't? 
* What seems good and bad about HTML?
* Did you have an "aha" moments or were any concepts solidified?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

HTML is, for the most part, coherent and straightforward. I don't understand the various distinctions between e.g. HTML 4 and HTML 5â€”there's an expansion of the number of available tags and attributes, but if there are any other distinctions, no one's yet mentioned them. 

HTML is an awfully bare-bones tool, which has its pros and cons. The syntax can be cumbersome and ungainly, and it takes a fair amount of massaging to get a page structured in a way that's not ugly as sin, but it makes small, efficient structures to shoot around the internet. I'm inclined to grumble about how non-intuitive it is to, say, shape a div tag into the shape and position I want, and until I get a better feel for things like pixel sizes in the context of a whole screen I'll have to do a fair amount of trial and error, but these seem like calculated tradeoffs rather than fatal flaws: even ignoring the fact that HTML was first made for a much, much slower internet, I'm starting to see how little sense it makes to bake in the kind of intuitive, good-looking defaults I'm wishing for, given e.g. the different demands of making a page for a computer verses a phone screen.

CSS, though, I have no reservations about. It's great. The cascading style specifications from more generic to more specific makes intuitive sense to me, and though I've never had a sufficiently in-depth HTML project to take advantage of it, making centralized changes on one stylesheet that affect many HTML files is just massively useful.

As for outside resources, I found a few useful lists of tags and selectors, but nothing about how the languages work (that I still remembered from CodeAcademy). It seems silly to list them: they're just minor references and even if I want to find them again, I'll just google "HTML [whatever I'm looking for]" again. But, in the name of thoroughness, I did use:
