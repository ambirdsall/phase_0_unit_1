## 2. [Open Source and Repo Setup](2_set_up_repo/readme.md) Reflection

* Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person
* Describe what open source means
* What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?
* Assess the importance of using licenses
* What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

To create a repository on GitHub, go to github.com/new. There, you have to choose a name for your repository, choose if it will be publicly available or invite-only, and decide whether it should be created with a readme file and/or a license. If you initialize it with a readme, you can clone it easily from the GitHub app—otherwise you'll have to initialize it in terminal. After creating the repository, view your repositories at github.com in the app, and click the "clone to computer" button next to your newly-created repository.

Open source refers to software that is distributed with the source code it was written in in addition to the machine language translation the computer actually runs. By letting users access the code, you make it possible for them to make changes and distribute your program, either as-is or modified, as they see fit. 

I think open source per se is a fantastic thing, though its intersection with capitalism makes for some slightly perverse incentives. User modifications open the door to functionalities the developer may not have thought of, to non-obvious tweaks that improve the user experience, and to a much wider knowledge base generally. All good things. I also really appreciate the ethic of sharing knowledge and letting users shape their experiences. Conversely, I think restricting access is something to be avoided when unnecessary—it's awfully easy to use that restriction in expoloitative ways. That said, as someone who hopes to make a living off of his code, the ways open source undercuts direct monitization of your intellectual property is a concern. Most especially since I make music, a field in which open access has been great for the end users but pretty thoroughly undermined artists' ability to make the aforementioned living.

The important distinction here, of course, is that unlike music, the developer (or his/her company, depending) gets to decide the level of access to their product through their choice of license before it's released into the wild. To release it, sans license, into the public domain is an extreme, saintly version of the open source ethic in which you, like most saints, won't make any money. Not that money's everything, but it's a big something.

The challenge was pretty straightforward, so there were no setbacks or "aha" moments, but it did reinforce how git projects, even on GitHub, are processed locally as you work. I'm still curious about what pushing/pulling data in real time looks like, though.
