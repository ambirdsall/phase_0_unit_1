## 6. [Wireframing](6_wireframing/readme.md) Reflection

* * What did you learn about design and user experience? 
* Do you like design and user experience? Was it fun working on your site, the plan, and/or the wireframe? (If you hated it, that's OK too)

* What questions did you ask during this challnge? What resources did you find to help you answer them?  
* What concepts are you having trouble with, or did you just figure something out? If so, what?  
* Did you learn any new skills or tricks?
* How confident are you with each of the Learning Competencies for this challenge? 
* Which parts of the challenge did you enjoy?
* Which parts of the challenge did you find tedious?

This was a really fun one. I recognized a lot of what I'm fundamentally hoping to do in my work in the design thinking wikipedia page; the top sections of that page were just a rigorous presentation of some things that were in some half-formed ways already in my head. Always a fun sensation. The comparison of design verses scientific methods was my jam.

Also, my day job is teaching art to children. Getting to work with my hands and draw things is something I do a lot, which I've come to find relaxing in my old age. But instead of a half-assed, tossed off thing made with a 2nd grader's attention span as a design parameter, I got to take a bit of time and draw boxes carefully. It was fun.

I also got to run around trying to articulate visual logic, which is a totally seperate kind of cognition. It's a fun game for me, because somehow the hopelessness of the task at hand mitigates my normal perfectionistic impulses when writing. I've always been acutely aware of the limitations of natural language, of the steep drops in information resolution going along [what we think => what we think we said => what we actually said]; normally there's some asymptotic hope in precisely getting across what you think, leading to perfectionism, but here, that being impossible, I just try to do my best and have some fun with it.

Honestly, this was just a fun change of pace. It wasn't too demanding, the repetitive bits were relaxing instead of boring, and I think it's something I've got at least a bit of talent at. It's just one challenge, and the honeymoon would end soon enough, but I'm pretty into wireframing so far.
