## 3. [Web Basics](3_web_basics/readme.md) Reflection

* What 2 new things did you learn about the web?
* What are some important things to remember when setting up your HTML site?
* How did you feel when you saw your web page live?
* Did you have an "aha" moments or were any concepts solidified?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

The biggest, or at least most fundamental, thing I learned was how DNS works. IP addresses I had seen and heard of, but the actual connection between them and the domain names people actually type was missing. I suspect I'd have guessed that it's a process of sending queries through big remote servers storing addresses, but the hierarchical organization of domain names from top level domains like "com" and down is an interesting wrinkle. The other thing that felt like genuinely new information rather than an elaboration or clarification of something I had a vague, osmotic grasp on was the distinction between "internet" and "web". I had always pegged them as totally synonymous, having not really thought through the web in the context of the full depth of computer-computer information exchange that is the internet.

The most important thing for me to remember, judging from that initial foray, is patience! It took every bit of the 10 minutes GitHub claims for my browser to make anything but a 404 error out of "ambirdsall.github.io", during which I had to fight a medium-strong impulse to run around like a chicken with my head cut off. So I'd say that I felt relief more than anything when I saw that baby go live. Beyond that, making your commits properly AND pushing them to GitHub (again, the git/GitHub divide rears its head!) isn't yet automatic.

Going back to DNS, going through smashingmagazine.com's walkthrough of finding its IP address via Terminal was one of those "I HAVE THE POWER" moments. Generally, learning more about the chain of computers information goes along as we use the web has helped clarify when and where different types of code are used. That, more than anything, has contextualized all these new languages and functionalities as things I can go out and use for real purposes in the real world.

As far as outside resources, I just used the list of OSX CLI commands at http://ss64.com/osx/ to refresh my memory. I also really liked getting a rundown of making browser preview build systems in Sublime that Sebastian Radloff put onto the July Firecrackers Google+ page (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8ufaPD-AnQ). It gave me something useful to do while waiting and fretting about my webpage's delayed reveal on GitHub.
